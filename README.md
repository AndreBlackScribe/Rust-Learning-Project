# ðŸ¦€ Rust Learning Project

Welcome to the **Rust Learning Project** â€” a hands-on, challenge-driven journey through the fundamentals of the Rust programming language. This repository is designed to help you build confidence and mastery in Rust through practical tasks, coding challenges, and guided hints.

## ðŸ“š Project Structure

Each topic is organized into its own folder:

```
rust_learning/
â”œâ”€â”€ 01_introduction/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.rs
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test.rs
â”œâ”€â”€ 02_get_started/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.rs
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test.rs
...
â”œâ”€â”€ 20_modules/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.rs
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test.rs
```

Each folder contains:
- `README.md` â€” task, challenge, hint, and bonus challenge
- `main.rs` â€” your implementation
- `test.rs` â€” unit tests (starting from topic 15)
