## Topic: References

### Task
Modify a string using a mutable reference passed to a function.

### Challenge
Use both mutable and immutable references in the same program.

### Hint
Rust enforces borrowing rules: you can't have mutable and immutable references to the same variable at the same time. Try separating them into different scopes.

### Bonus Challenge
Write a function that takes a reference to a vector and prints its length without taking ownership.
