## Topic: Variables

### Task
Create a program that uses both mutable and immutable variables. Print their values before and after modification.

### Challenge
Use variable shadowing to redefine a variable with a new type or value.

### Hint
Use `let mut` for mutable variables. Shadowing is done by re-declaring a variable with `let` in the same scope.

### Bonus Challenge
Create a function that takes a mutable reference to a variable and modifies it. Print the value before and after the function call.
