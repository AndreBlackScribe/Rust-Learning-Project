### Task
Create a program that declares variables of different types (`i32`, `f64`, `bool`, `char`) and prints them.

### Challenge
Create a function that takes these variables and returns a formatted string.

### Hint
Use `format!()` to build a string and return it from your function.

### Bonus Challenge
Use Rust's type inference to declare variables without explicitly specifying their types, and verify their types using comments or tests.
