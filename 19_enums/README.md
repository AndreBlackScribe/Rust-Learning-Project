## Topic: Enums

### Task
Define a `TrafficLight` enum with variants: Red, Yellow, Green. Print the current light.

### Challenge
Add a method to `TrafficLight` that returns the duration (in seconds) each light stays on.

### Hint
Use `impl TrafficLight` and match on `self` to return different durations.

### Bonus Challenge
Implement a function that takes a `TrafficLight` and prints a message based on its variant.
