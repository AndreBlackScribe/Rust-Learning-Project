## Topic: Comments

### Task
Write a Rust program that uses both single-line and multi-line comments to explain each part of the code.

### Challenge
Write a mini-guide in comments explaining how Rust handles memory safety.

### Hint
Use `//` for single-line comments and `/* ... */` for multi-line comments. Mention ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes in your guide.

### Bonus Challenge
Add a commented-out block of code that would cause a compile-time error due to ownership rules, and explain why.
