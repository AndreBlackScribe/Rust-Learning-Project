## Topic: Match

### Task
Create a program that uses `match` to print the name of the day based on a number (1 = Monday, ..., 7 = Sunday).

### Challenge
Add a default case for invalid input and handle it gracefully.

### Hint
Use `match` with pattern arms for each number. Use `_` for the default case.

### Bonus Challenge
Write a function that returns a custom message based on the day, e.g., "Start of the week" for Monday, "Weekend!" for Saturday/Sunday.
