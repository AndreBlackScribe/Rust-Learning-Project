### Task
Install Rust and run a "Hello, world!" program using Cargo.

### Challenge
Modify the program to take a name from the command line and greet the user.

### Hint
Use `std::env::args()` to read command-line arguments. The first argument is the program name, so skip it.

### Bonus Challenge
Create a function that returns a personalized greeting based on the name, and print it.
