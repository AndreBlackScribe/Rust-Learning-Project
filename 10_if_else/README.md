## Topic: If...Else

### Task
Create a program that takes a number and prints whether itâ€™s positive, negative, or zero.

### Challenge
Extend the program to classify numbers as small, medium, or large based on value ranges.

### Hint
Use `if`, `else if`, and `else` blocks. For example: `if x < 10 { ... } else if x < 100 { ... } else { ... }`.

### Bonus Challenge
Write a function that returns a descriptive string based on the classification and prints it.
