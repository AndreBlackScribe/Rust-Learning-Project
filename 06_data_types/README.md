## Topic: Data Types

### Task
Write a program that demonstrates usage of all basic data types: integers, floats, booleans, characters, and tuples.

### Challenge
Create a tuple with mixed types and destructure it into variables. Print each variable.

### Hint
Use `let (a, b, c) = tuple;` to destructure. Tuples can hold values of different types.

### Bonus Challenge
Create a function that takes a tuple as input and returns a formatted string describing its contents.
