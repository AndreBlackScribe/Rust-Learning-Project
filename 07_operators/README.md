## Topic: Operators

### Task
Build a simple calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers.

### Challenge
Extend the calculator to support exponentiation and modulus operations.

### Hint
Use `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` for basic arithmetic. Use `x.pow(n)` for exponentiation (only works with integers).

### Bonus Challenge
Create a function that takes an operator as a string (e.g., "+", "*") and performs the corresponding operation using pattern matching.
